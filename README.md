# Network Scan

Network Scan is a tool for scanning devices in your local network.
This project is in its early stages of development.


## Why?

network-scan is born out of the frustration of dealing with either overly complex or paid network scanning tools.
It's a middleground between free but complex tools like nmap and paid but easy to use tools like lanscan.

## Features

- [ ] Discover all the devices on your network
- [ ] Show device vendor info
- [ ] If the device can be pinged
- [ ] mDNS name of the device
- [ ] scan for open ports on devices (unsure about this one)
- [ ] install using shell command: `curl script_url | bash`
- [ ] install using go: `go install`
