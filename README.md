# Network Scan

Network Scan is a tool for scanning devices in your local network.
This project is in its early stages of development.


## Why?

network-scan is born out of the frustration of dealing with either overly complex or paid network scanning tools.
It's a middleground between free but complex tools like nmap and paid but easy to use tools like lanscan.
